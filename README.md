# Traditional computer vision algorithms course of ABBYY, MIPT
- [First homework](https://github.com/Khaymon/cv_course_2022/tree/master/homework1) is devoted to VNG demosaicing algorithm needed to retrieve original image from
Bayer filter,
- [Second homework](https://github.com/Khaymon/cv_course_2022/tree/master/homework2) is for different algorithms of median filtering. It is needed to decrease the level
of noise in image and prepare it for latest operations in a pipeline,
- [Third homework](https://github.com/Khaymon/cv_course_2022/tree/master/homework3) is for determining the rotation angle of text. It uses Fast Hough Transform which finds the best 2D-line parameters between dots of black-white image.
